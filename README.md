# Installing Pi-Hole and PiVPN on a Digital Ocean VPS

**This guide is still a work-in-progress. Many critical steps are missing. I would not recommend following the guide as-is right now.**

## Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to document the steps I took to create a droplet on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) with [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [PiVPN](http://www.pivpn.io/) installed. The ultimate goal is to have an ad-blocker that will work both on my home network and on any device connected to the VPN.

Almost every tutorial I found was focused on installing Pi-Hole and PiVPN on a local Raspberry Pi instead of a VPS. The steps are mostly the same but there are some extra steps involved in securing the VPS to deny access from bad actors.

After completing this tutorial, you will have:

- A Pi-Hole accessible from anywhere
- A VPN that will provide an encrypted connection when using public Wi-Fi

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this tutorial you will need to have a DigitalOcean account. If you do not have one, you can [sign up here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new).

## Creating a Droplet

This tutorial will use **Ubuntu 16.04 x64** as the base image. 16.04 is a long-term support release of Ubuntu and supports all of the software we will be installing. You can pick a different Linux distrobution if you wish, but be cautioned that the software may not work without some extra effort on your part.

- Go the the [Create Droplet](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new) page in your DigitalOcean account
- Choose an Image
  - Select _Distributions_ and then _Ubuntu_. If _16.04_ is not selected by default, select it in the dropdown menu.
- Choose a size
  - `$5/mo` will be large enough for this tutorial. You can select a larger size later if necessary.
- Choose a datacenter region
  - I recommend selecting a region that is closest to you
- Select Additional Options
  - Select `IPv6` so that we can block ads that are served on that protocol
  - (Optional) Select `Monitoring` for additional monitoring features provided by DigitalOcean
- Add your SSH keys
  - Do not add any SSH keys yet. We will add them later.
- Finalize and create
  - Make sure you are creating a single droplet
  - Choose a hostname, e.g. `nledford-pihole`
  - Click the **Create** button

DigitalOcean will start the process of creating the droplet for you and will send you an email containing the root password for your droplet. We will need that root password before we can log into and configure our new droplet. The root password will be changed after your first login.

## Initial Server Setup

Once you have created your droplet, you should be redirected to the [Droplets page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets) that lists all of your Droplets and Volumes. You will need the IP address and your root password to log into your new droplet.  We will be using `ssh` to remotely log into the Droplet and configure it. If you are on a Unix-based operating system, it should already be installed. If you are Windows, you will need to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).

This section essentially covers all of the steps from [DigitalOcean's tutorial for setting up Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04), but with a few differences. We will be creating a specific user, `pi`, that will use for logging into the VPS and handling the `.ovpn` files generated by PiVPN.

### Root Login

- When you have your server's IP address and root password, log into the server as the `root` user
    ```shell
    ssh root@your_server_ip
    ```
- You will be asked to create a new password. Although we will be disabling password authentication, be sure to create a secure password anyway.
- Create new user `pi`
    ```shell
    adduser pi
    ```
- Grant root privileges to `pi`
    ```shell
    usermod -aG sudo pi
    ```

### Public Key Authentication

[Public Key Authentication](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.55/htmldoc/Chapter8.html) provides an alternative method of identifying yourselve to a remote server and increases the overall security of your server.

- If you do not already have an SSH key, you will need to create one on your local computer
    ```shell
    ssh-keygen
    ```
- Save your key in the default file (where `$user` is your user)
    ```shell
    Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/$user/.ssh/id_rsa):
    ```
- Create a secure passphrase. You will need to enter this passphrase each time you utilize your SSH key
- Copy the public key from your local machine to your remote server with `ssh-copy-id`
    ```shell
    ssh-copy-id pi@your_server_ip
    ```
  - If you opted to add SSH during the droplet creation process anyway, this method will not work.
- You should repeat this steps for each device you want to access the server, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Once you have added SSH keys from all of your devices, we can disable password authentication.

- Log into your server as `root`, if you are not already logged in
    ```shell
    ssh root@your_server_ip
    ```
- Open the SSH daemon configuration file
    ```shell
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssdh_config
    ```
- Find the line containing `PasswordAuthentication` and uncomment it by deleting the preceeding `#`. Change it's value to **no**
- Find the line containing `PubkeyAuthentication` and ensure it's value is set to **yes**
- Find the line containing `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` and ensure it's value is set to **no**
- Save your changes and close the file
  - `CTRL + X`
  - `Y`
  - `ENTER`
- While still logged in as `root`, open a new terminal window and test logging in as `pi` and verify that the public key authentication works
    ```shell
    ssh pi@your_server_ip
    ```

### (Optional) Install Mosh

[Mosh](https://mosh.org/), or mobile shell, is a remote termina application that allows roaming and intermittent connectivity. It's intended as a replacement for SSH but both can be used on the same server.

```shell
# Update your sources, if necessary
sudo apt update

# Install mosh
sudo apt install mosh
```

### Set up `ufw`

We will set up a basic firewall, [`ufw`](https://wiki.debian.org/Uncomplicated%20Firewall%20%28ufw%29), that will restrict access to certain services on the server. Specifically, we want to ensure that only ports needed for SSH, Pi-Hole, and PiVPN are open. Additional ports can be opened depending on your specific needs.

We will be opening ports for secure FTP so that `.ovpn` files needed for connecting to our VPN later can be retrieved via a FTP application such as Filezilla or Transmit.

- Set up `ufw`
    ```shell
    # Apply basic defaults
    sudo ufw default deny incoming
    sudo ufw default allow outgoing

    # Open ports for OpenSSH
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

    # Optionally, allow all access from your IP Address
    sudo ufw allow from $yourIPAddress

    # Open ports for secure FTP
    sudo ufw allow sftp

    # Open ports for Mosh if you installed it
    sudo ufw allow mosh
    ```

## Install Pi-Hole

Now that our server has been set up and is secure, we will now install the Pi-Hole software. The installation is fairly simple and requires a small amount of configuration on our part.

Please note that on a Raspberry Pi we would be asked to set a [static IP address](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/3547208?hl=en). This is important because we do not want the IP address of a DNS server to be constantly changing. However, since we are using a VPS, the static IP address has already been set for us. The networking interface will also be automatically selected as well since only one, `eth0`, will be available to us at the time of installation.

- Run the offical [Pi-Hole Installer](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh)
    ```shell
    curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
    ```
- When asked about which protocols to use for blocking ads, select both `IPv4` and `IPv6`, even if you cannot use `IPv6` yet on your home network. The justification is that more ads are now being served via `IPv6` and we want to ensure all ads are blocked
- On the very last screen, you will be presented various information about your new Pi-Hole installation. Your Pi-Hole's IP address should match your server's IP address.

Once you have completed the Pi-Hole installation script, you should change the passphrase to the admin panel:

```shell
pihole -a -p myawesomepassphrase
```

## Install PiVPN

- Run the offical [PiVPN Installer](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/blob/master/auto_install/install.sh)
  ```shell
  curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash
  ```
- On a Raspberry Pi, we would be asked to select a network interface, but since we are on a VPS the only available interface is `eth0` and that is automatically selected for us
- The static IP address is also automatically selected for us
- When asked to choose a local user to hold your `ovpn` configurations, select the user `pi`
- When asked about enabling Unattended Upgrades, pick yes
- When asked to select the protocol, pick `UDP`
- When asked to select the port, either accept the default `1194` or enter a random port such as `11948`
- When asked to set the size of your encryption key, select `2048`
  - Generating the encryption key will take a few minutes
- When asked to select a Public IP or DNS, select your server's IP address
- When asked to select a DNS provider, either accept Google as the default (`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`) or select custom and enter your preferred DNS providers
- Allow the installer to reboot your VPS

## OpenVPN

- Create an OpenVPN profile
    ```shell
    # Create ovpn profile with a password
    pivpn add

    # create ovpn profile WITHOUT a password
    pivpn add -nopass
    ```
- TODO add instructions on how to retrieve `.ovpn` profile from VPS using FTP application
- TODO add instructions on how to use `.ovpn` profile with OpenVPN clients
- Make final adjustments to files on your VPS
